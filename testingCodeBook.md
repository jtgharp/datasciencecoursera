## Code Book

### Activities and Subject
  These variables identify the unique subject/activity pair. Each pair serves as a key for one row of data. 
  
  #### Subject: 
       Each Subject identified using the integer subject ID.
        
  #### Activity: 
        ActivityId: Unique Identifier for Activity
  #### Activity Type:    These are associated to Activity Id 1 through 6
    Walking
    Walking Upstairs
    Walking Downstairs
    Sitting
    Standing
    Laying
    
 #### Note to Reviewer: 
 ##### In my final write out of the tidy data set I have suppressed the activity type (labels as for each row we still have the activitiyId)  
 ##### See last line in the code: write.table(avgActSubj, f, row.names = FALSE) 
 ### Measurement Means:
 #### All variables are the mean of a measurement for each activity and subject. This is stressed by use of the initial Mean in the variable name.
##### Following are Time Domain body acceleration means along X, Y and Z axes
* MeanTimeBodyAccMean-X
* MeanTimeBodyAccMean-Y
* MeanTimeBodyAccMean-Z
##### Following are Time Domain gravity acceleration means along X, Y and Z axes
* MeanTimeGravityAccMean-X
